# Face-Mask-Detection-System

A face mask detection system is a computer vision-based technology designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time. This system can be implemented in various public places such as hospitals, schools, airports, malls, and other crowded areas to enforce compliance with the mandatory wearing of face masks.

The system works by using a camera and a software algorithm to analyze the facial features of individuals in the camera's view. The algorithm detects the presence or absence of a face mask and sends a notification to a control center or a security personnel if someone is not wearing a mask.

The face mask detection system uses deep learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accurately detect and recognize faces and identify whether or not they are wearing a mask. The CNNs are trained on a large dataset of masked and unmasked faces, and are able to distinguish between the two with high accuracy.

The system can be integrated with an access control system to prevent entry of individuals without a mask, or it can be used to trigger an alert for a security personnel to approach the individual and remind them to wear a mask. In addition, the system can generate real-time data reports to help authorities monitor compliance with mask-wearing policies.

Overall, the face mask detection system is an innovative technology that can help promote public health and safety by ensuring that individuals wear masks in public areas where it is mandatory.
